    <h1 class="title">THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="authors">Bre Pettis and Kio Stark</div>
<h2>
      <div class="item item1">There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.</div>

      <div class="item item2">Accept that everything is a draft.
      It helps to get done.</div>

      <div class="item item3">There is no editing stage.</div>

      <div class="item 4">Pretending</em> you know what you’re doing is almost the same as <em>knowing</em> what you are doing,<br>
      so just accept that you know what you are doing
      what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it<br></div>

      <div class="item 5">Banish procrastination. If you wait more
      than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.</div>

      <div class="item 6">The point of being done is not to finish but
      to get other things done.</div>

      <div class="item 7">Once you’re done you can throw it away.</div>

      <div class="item 8">Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
      you from being done.</div>

      <div class="item 9">People without dirty hands are wrong.
      Doing something makes you right.</div>

      <div class="item 10">Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.</div>

      <div class="item 11">Destruction is a variant of done.</div>

      <div class="item 12">If you have an idea and publish it on the
      internet, that counts as a ghost of done.</div>

      <div class="item 13" style="">Done is the engine of more.</div>
