      <li>There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.</li>

      <div class="title title2" id="#2"><a href="#3">THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO</a></div>
      <li>Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get done.</li>

      <div class="title title3" id="#3"><a href="#4">THE CULT OF DONE MANIFESTO</a></div>
      <li>There is no editing stage.</li>

      <li>Pretending</em> you know what you’re doing is almost the same as <em>knowing</em> what you are doing,
      so just accept that you know what you are doing
      what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it<br></li>

      <li>Banish procrastination. If you wait more
      than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.</li>

      <li>The point of being done is not to finish but
      to get other things done.</li>

      <li>Once you’re done you can throw it away.</li>

      <li>Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
      you from being done.</li>

      <li>People without dirty hands are wrong.
      Doing something makes you right.</li>

      <li>Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.</li>

      <li>Destruction is a variant of done.</li>

      <li>If you have an idea and publish it on the
      internet, that counts as a ghost of done.</li>

      <li id="item13">Done is the engine of more.</li>
